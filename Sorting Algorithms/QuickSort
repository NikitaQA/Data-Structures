// divide and conquer. select pivot element randomly(mostly last), then compare each element with pivot take all elements less than pivot on left of pivot 
   and greater on right of pivot. 
   (take cur and i ptr. compare cur with pivot if greater then cur++ else swap cur with i and i++, cur++. when reach to pivot then swap 
    with i now recursively apply this algo on each subarray by selecting pivot again.)
